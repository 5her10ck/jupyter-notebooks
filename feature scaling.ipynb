    "<p>Whenever you are dealing with features or parameters that differ from each other in terms of range of values (which is the case in most of data sets) then you have to normalise the data so that the difference in these range of values does not affect your outcome.<p>\n",
    "<p>For e.g you want to see how speed of running of an athlete depends on his weight and height. Here the factors will be height and weight. Height ranges from say 4 feet to 7 feet while weight ranges from say 50 kgs to 120 kgs. If we feed in these factors in the model as it is then the model will give a higher weightage to weight as compared to height because the values for weights are larger than heights. This may not give us desired results. To overcome this, we would have to rescale or standardise the two features so that their range is comparable. And these values will now be fed to the model.</p>\n",

    "<strong>eg 2 :</strong> <p>he age of employees in a company may be between 21-70 years, the size of the house they live is 500-5000 Sq feet and their salaries may range from $30000-$80000. In this situation if you use a simple Euclidean metric, the age feature will not play any role because it is several order smaller than other features. However, it may contain some important information that may be useful for the task. Here, you may want to normalize the features independently to the same scale, say [0,1], so they contribute equally while computing the distance.</p>"
